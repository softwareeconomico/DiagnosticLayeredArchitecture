# Layered Architecture Template

A template for organizing software projects using **Layered Architecture**. This approach separates the application into different layers, each with specific responsibilities, to improve maintainability, scalability, and testability.

## **Introduction**

Layered Architecture is a design pattern that divides an application into layers with clear separation of concerns. Each layer only interacts with the layer directly below it, and the layers can be developed, maintained, and tested independently.

This template provides a clean structure for implementing a layered architecture in a software project. It organizes the project into clear layers that help with the separation of responsibilities and make it easier to scale and maintain.

## **Principles of Layered Architecture**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility and does not overlap with the responsibilities of other layers.
2. **Loose Coupling**: Layers communicate with each other through defined interfaces, ensuring that changes to one layer do not affect others.
3. **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently, and the business logic is isolated from external dependencies like databases or frameworks.
4. **Scalability**: New features can be added to individual layers without disrupting the whole system.

## **Project Structure**

```
/myapp
  /presentation       # Presentation Layer: User interaction (UI)
    /views            # Views: Forms, web pages, graphical interfaces
    /controllers      # Controllers: Manages events and data flow from the UI
    /models           # View Models: Data representation for the UI

  /business           # Business Logic Layer: Application rules and logic
    /services         # Services: Contains core business logic
    /models           # Business Entities: Domain objects representing the business domain
    /use_cases        # Use Cases: Business process and task logic

  /data               # Data Access Layer: Data persistence and retrieval
    /repositories     # Repositories: Access data from databases or other services
    /entities         # Entities: Data models, representations of database tables
    /migrations       # Database migrations: Structure and changes to the database

  /infrastructure     # Service/Infrastructure Layer: Interactions with external services
    /services         # External services: APIs, email, payment services, etc.
    /frameworks       # Frameworks and third-party libraries
    /config           # Configuration files

  /tests              # Testing Layer: Tests for each layer or component
    /presentation     # Tests for the presentation layer
    /business         # Tests for the business logic layer
    /data             # Tests for the data access layer
    /integration      # Integration tests between layers and services
```

## Layer Descriptions

### **Presentation Layer**:

This layer interacts with the user, displaying information and receiving input.
- **/views**: UI components (web pages, forms, graphical interfaces).
- **/controllers**: Handles user input, manages events, and coordinates actions between the UI and business logic.
- **/models**: Represents the data the UI works with (View Models), structured to suit the UI.

### **Business Logic Layer**:

This layer contains the applicationâ€™s core functionality and business rules.
- **/services**: The core business logic and application workflows.
- **/models**: Domain objects that represent real-world entities in the application (e.g., "Product," "Order").
- **/use_cases**: Defines business processes and tasks, outlining the steps for specific actions in the application.

### **Data Access Layer**:

This layer handles the interaction with data storage, such as databases or external APIs.
- **/repositories**: Data access logic, including retrieval and persistence operations.
- **/entities**: Data models representing database tables or external data structures.
- **/migrations**: Scripts for managing database schema changes.

### **Infrastructure Layer**:

The infrastructure layer deals with external systems and services, such as email, APIs, or third-party services.
- **/services**: External integrations like APIs, email services, or payment processors.
- **/frameworks**: Framework-specific configurations or tools.
- **/config**: Configuration files for the system (e.g., database connections, API keys).

### **Testing Layer**:

Contains tests for different layers of the application to ensure that each part behaves as expected.
- **/integration**: Tests that check how different layers work together.
- **/presentation**, **/business**, **/data**: Unit tests specific to each layer, ensuring the functionality of the application.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/layered-architecture-template.git
   cd layered-architecture-template
    ```
   
2. Set up your project dependencies and tools according to your framework or technology stack.

3. Begin implementing features by defining:

- Entities and Use Cases in the Business Logic Layer.
- Services and Repositories in the Data Access Layer.
- Views, Controllers, and Models in the Presentation Layer.
- External services and configurations in the Infrastructure Layer.
- Write unit and integration tests for each layer under the tests folder.

##  **Why Use This Architecture?**

- Maintainability: Changes in one layer have minimal impact on others.
- Scalability: New features can be added to specific layers without disrupting the overall system.
- Testability: Isolated layers allow for focused testing of business logic and external systems.
- Flexibility: Switching frameworks, databases, or technologies is easier since dependencies are managed through well-defined interfaces.
